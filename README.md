1.For project details, refer to the YouTube video: 
Fluid Structure Interaction Analysis on Aircraft Wing | Ansys CFX | Pressure Mapping | 1-way FSI

2.Hong Kong Polytechnic University ASRC has the software licenses for Siemens NX and Fluent, the 
software used in the entire simulation process.

3.The purpose of creating this project is to enhance my own learning and strengthening of fluid-structure interaction simulation, 
and there is no other commercial purpose or conflict of interest.
